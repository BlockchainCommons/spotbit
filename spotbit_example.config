#### Spotbit Configuration File ####
# There are currently 3 allowed fields in this file: 
# - pruneDepth: The number of allowed rows in the database (default 100,000 rows) 
# - exchanges: Exchanges to collect data for. If there is no option here, then Spotbit will use a demo subset of exchanges in memory. There are more than 100 exchanges supported, but Spotbit will not gather information for all these by default. Exchanges should be separated by spaces. 
# - currencies: Currencies to collect data for. If a currency is supported by an exchange, then data can be collected for it. Currencies should be lowercase three letter currency codes, eg usd gpy cny jpy eur. If no currencies are listed then Spotbit will collect for usd only. 
# Lines with '#' are ignored by Spotbit. 
# Lines that do not represent a valid configuration option will be ignored.
